# 🚀 Challenge: Retrieve All Active Products  

## 📖 Introduction  
You are working for an **e-commerce platform** that sells both **physical and digital products**. The company wants to display only **active products** to customers. Your task is to retrieve these active products from the `products` table.  

---

## 🎯 Challenge Specification  
Write an SQL query to fetch all **active products** from the `products` table. A product is considered active if `is_active = TRUE`.  

### ✅ Requirements:  
- Select the following columns:  
  - `id` (Product ID)  
  - `name` (Product Name)  
  - `price` (Product Price)  
  - `is_active` (Product is_active)
- Only include products where **`is_active = TRUE`**.  
- Order the results by **`created_at` in descending order** (newest first).

## 🗄️ Sample Data  
Here’s an example of the `products` table _(The actual data can be found in `init.sql`)_:  

| id | name        | slug        | description             | price  | is_digital | is_active | created_at          |
